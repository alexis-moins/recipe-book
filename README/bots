# Training

## 🚀 Setup

Navigate to the [training](.) directory
```bash
cd functions/training/
```

Create a virtual environment for python 3.11 using the [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚦 Environment

You must set environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of the project. To do so, copy the local [.env](.env.local) file and optionally change its content.
```bash
cp .env.local .env
```

## 🧰 Settings

You can change how the training is done by tweaking your .env file's `FREQUENCY` and `START_DATE`. See the local [.env](.env.local) file for more information about each variable's purpose.

## 🛎️ Running

First ensure that your virtual environment is activated, then launch the [main.py](main.py) file using your python interpreter.

> Note that you need to have the global docker compose environment for the bots running as explained in the repository's general [README](../../README.md).
